### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Data Scientist with ARC Resources in Calgary, Alberta.

My journey into data science has been a meandering one. I completed an M.A.Sc. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia (Canada), following which, I spent some time developing improved algorithms for treating atrial fibrillation at Toronto General Hospital's Cardiology Department. This work led to several publications and a couple of patents.

Before my current role, I worked as a Risk Analyst at the Bank of Montreal. Subsequently, I served as a Data Scientist at Teknobuilt, Canada, tackling various data science challenges within the construction sector.

I am deeply interested in Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning, and actively engage with it both professionally and as a personal hobby.

### My Work & Interests
